This assignment is not fully completed as per the given requirements, but I have built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Node.js, Express, and Routing to demonstrate backend functionality.

I structured the project with Express routes to handle different HTTP requests efficiently. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations, making it easy to manage data.
Although the full implementation is incomplete, this backend setup showcases my ability to build and organize a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.
